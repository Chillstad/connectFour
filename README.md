# connectFour
A connect 4 program in c++ that aims to implement the game without arrays or classes.

It was designed to show how someone without knowledge of arrays or classes could make a game like this.

Yes, strings are an array, but the average beginner programmer understands strings more than arrays, so I argue that this approach is most intuitive for then.
